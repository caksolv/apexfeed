    <h1>Top 10 Productivity Tools for Developers in 2025</h1>
    <p><em>April 15, 2025</em></p>

    <p>In the fast-paced world of software development, productivity isn’t just about writing more code—it's about working smarter. With the right tools, developers can streamline workflows, avoid distractions, and focus on what matters most: building great products.</p>

    <h2>Why Productivity Matters</h2>
    <p>Improving productivity isn't just good for business—it helps reduce burnout, improve code quality, and make daily tasks more enjoyable. Whether you're working remotely or in a team environment, staying organized and efficient can make or break your momentum.</p>

    <h3>Top Tools to Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VS Code</strong>: A lightweight but powerful source-code editor with support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more. Extensions like GitLens, Prettier, and Live Server enhance your workflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Notion</strong>: Ideal for organizing projects, managing documentation, and personal productivity. Its flexibility makes it suitable for solo developers and teams alike.</li>
      <li><strong>Pomofocus</strong>: Based on the Pomodoro Technique, this tool helps you break your work into intervals to maintain focus and energy throughout the day.</li>
      <li><strong>Linear</strong>: A modern issue-tracking and project management tool that’s fast, keyboard-first, and optimized for developer workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Raycast</strong>: A Mac-only productivity tool that lets you launch apps, run scripts, manage tasks, and control dev tools using simple keyboard commands.</li>
      <li><strong>Figma</strong>: Though primarily a design tool, Figma helps developers collaborate with designers efficiently, reducing back-and-forth on UI requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>: AI-powered code suggestions right inside your editor. Great for speeding up repetitive coding tasks and exploring new languages/frameworks.</li>
      <li><strong>Slack</strong>: Still one of the best tools for team communication, especially when paired with integrations like GitHub and CI/CD alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>RescueTime</strong>: Tracks how you spend your time on your computer to give you insights and help you cut distractions.</li>
      <li><strong>Postman</strong>: A must-have for testing APIs quickly and collaborating on API development with team members.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As we move further into 2025, developers are expected to juggle multiple tools and responsibilities. Mastering these productivity tools can lead to cleaner code, faster development cycles, and ultimately—happier devs.</p>
